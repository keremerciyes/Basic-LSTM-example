# Basic LSTM Example

This repository contains a basic demonstration of using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network to predict a sine function.

## Overview

The notebook showcases the following:
- Generating and visualizing a sine wave dataset.
- Building and training an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Predicting future values of the sine wave using the trained model.
- Visualizing the model's predictions compared to the actual values.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

To run the notebook, simply open `basic_LSTM_example.ipynb` in your Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab environment and execute the cells in order.

## Results

The model's predictions are plotted against the actual sine wave, demonstrating the LSTM's ability to capture the periodic nature of the sine function.
